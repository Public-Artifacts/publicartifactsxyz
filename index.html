<p>Artifacts are often said to be things intentionally created to serve a certain function, where function plays the dominant role in classifying artifacts into artifactual kinds. Here I argue, however, that artifacts need not have intended functions and that even when they do, that does not always play a core role in artifactual classification. Artifacts, I argue, must have intended&nbsp;<i>features</i>, but these may include not only functional but also structural, perceptible, or even receptive and normative features regarding how the object is to be regarded, used, or treated. Indeed, I argue that members of&nbsp;<i>public</i>&nbsp;artifact kinds depend on the existence of public norms of treatment. Recognizing the role of receptive and normative features in public artifact kinds enables us to provide a better account of artifact categorization, solve old puzzles about exaptation and minimal creation, and provide a better understanding of the significance of artifacts in our lives and in the social sciences.</p>
